# Introduction

Many integrated fishery stock assessments rely on estimates of fish population demographic composition information in the form of length composition [@Punt2013] or as a derived quantity from length composition expanded to age composition [@Maunder2015]. 
The most reliable age and length composition estimates are based on observations from fishery-independent surveys because these platforms generally avoid the sample selection bias inherent in directed commercial fisheries [@NRC1998]. 
Past analyses have focused on the statistical efficiency of composition estimates for data weighting and applications to likelihood functions [e.g., @Thorson2014; @Thorson2017; @Francis2017]. 
It is recognized in sampling theory that increasing the number of samples increases the precision of the estimate, and from this perspective, one should require the maximum number of samples per each survey observation. 
However, to increase the precision of age or length composition estimates it’s not just the magnitude of sampling that is influential, but also the manner in which the samples are collected [@Siskey2022]. 
Further, each fish sampled on a survey has both an immediate physical labor cost (e.g., at-sea time management issues), a cumulative health cost (e.g., repetitive stress injuries), downstream labor costs (e.g., staff that read otoliths to determine age), and budget costs (e.g., the monetary cost to perform a fisheries-independent survey).

It has become commonly understood that sampling to determine age and length composition on fishery-independent or fishery-dependent platforms can be influenced by intra-haul correlation, or, that samples are taken from a school of fish that are very similar to each other in size and/or age that may not be representative of the overall population’s size and/or age distribution [e.g., @Pennington2000]. 
In order to evaluate and identify the level of intra-haul correlation, and how this can be accounted for in stock assessment, the concept of ‘effective sample size’ has been developed, in which the effective sample size is smaller than the actual sample size and reflects the increase in uncertainty that is due to the intra-haul correlation displayed by the species that are sampled [e.g., @Mcallister1997]. 
A number of studies have used effective sample size to evaluate the impact on assessment results including whether effective sample size can be estimated by the assessment model (@Francis2017; @Thorson2017; @Hulson2012) and more recently as a tool to evaluate the implications of changes to sampling methodologies and the subsequent influence on assessment model results [@Siskey2022]. 
Further, methods have been developed that mimic the sampling design for length and age composition that estimate effective sample size from collected samples (@Stewart2014).
Overall, the use of effective sample size has become a universal method to evaluate uncertainty in length and age composition data.

Within a fishery-independent survey, thousands of samples are obtained for both age and length composition across multiple species.
For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) has conducted effort-standardized bottom trawl surveys in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and Aleutian Islands (AI) since 1982 [@Stauffer2004] and these resource surveys comprehensively catalog the biota encountered at each sampling station. 
There are a number of unintended consequences associated with intense sampling of species within a fishery-independent survey.
The length measurement process is repeated over 100,000 times in a given survey each year, while collecting otoliths is repeated several thousands of times, representing a daunting amount of work for the field scientists working on research vessels.
Further, a large portion of the length frequency data that is collected is subsequently sampled for sex determinations in order to support stock assessments that are sex-specific, which involves a substantial increase in handling and data collection effort.
Each year, this work flow results in acute and repetitive stress injuries, some requiring medical interventions and claims to the U.S. Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. 
Another consequence of the intensity of this work are unrecoverable errors in the observed data; as fatigue or injuries accumulate during the course of field work, so do data collection errors (e.g. failure to properly encode length measurements with the correct species or sex or incorrect identification of sex), despite extensive *in situ* quality assurance protocols.
Besides the budgetary constraints that are directly associated with operationalizing a fishery-independent survey, there are downstream budgetary constraints associated with composition collections, in particular, requiring properly trained staff to read otoliths collected across a number of different species.

While maximizing the number of samples collected for age and length composition is desirable from a statistical viewpoint, it is becoming increasingly the case that optimizing collections that balance the statistical quality of the data with the health of the workforce and budgetary constraints is more broadly desirable.
And in this case, optimizing collections is more often associated with decreasing collection efforts from historical levels.
From the stock assessment perspective, the primary concern when reducing the sampling of length frequency data (whether sex-specific or not) and age composition data collections is the impact on the uncertainty in subsequent age and length composition data. 
The use of effective sample size, particularity when evaluating sampling strategies, is a useful tool to determine the consequences of changing sampling effort.
An additional consideration when evaluating the consequences of optimizing sampling effort is the impacts on a species-by-species basis to determine whether there are life-history characteristics that minimize the impacts of reduction in sampling effort in one species compared to another.

In this study, using data collected by the AFSC bottom trawl surveys across the EBS, AI, and GOA we evaluate the consequences of reductions in length frequency collections (including sex-specific length frequency) coupled with reductions in age composition sampling.
Using effective sample size as the primary statistic to evaluate uncertainty in the age and length composition data that is derived from the bottom trawl surveys, we evaluated the impact of reducing sampling to answer three questions 1) what is the impact of reducing sampling in length frequency sampling (including sex determination sampling) and the subsequent expansion to age composition on the uncertainty in the composition data? 2) Is there a point of diminishing returns as we increase the number of age and length samples? And, 3) are there life-history characteristics that mitigate, or exaggerate, the consequences of reductions in age or length composition sampling?

## Simulation-Bootstrap framework

[Included what we had from tech memo to build on - Ben and Pete]

To evaluate the effect of sub-sampling length frequency collections for which sex is subsequently determined we developed a bootstrap-simulation framework that allowed for reductions in the number of sexed length frequencies collected.
We used the historical length frequency data that were collected from the bottom trawl surveys to evaluate the impact of reduced sex-specific length frequency data. 
In simple terms, the simulation framework that we developed would select a pre-determined number of fish from the length frequency collections that would then be subsequently sexed, the remaining length frequency data (regardless of whether sex was actually determined in the historical data) was classified as ‘unsexed’. 

The bootstrap-simulation framework is composed of a suite of nested resampling protocols. 
Bootstrap resampling was performed either with replacement (wr) or without replacement (wor) depending on the needs of a particular protocol. 
Functions to run the sampling protocols were developed in a compartmentalized manner to provide for substantial flexibility in exploring desired resampling protocols. 
The order of operations (Figure \@ref(fig:length)) has the following schedule, with steps 1-3 being optional switches:

1. Resample hauls (wr) from the set of hauls with associated catch per unit effort (in numbers) 
2. Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample the observed lengths (wr)
3. From the resampled lengths in step 2, subset the lengths (wor) with observed sex (either male or female) and sample these sex-length pairs at the sub-sampling level determined in step 2; equation \@ref(eq:eqn6)
4. Calculate sex-specific population abundance at length, using equations \@ref(eq:eqn1) - \@ref(eq:eqn5)

The core of the bootstrap-simulation function (step 3 above) is designed to explore reductions in the sample size of lengths that are then sexed on a per haul basis. 
In this bootstrap-simulation, the number of lengths in a given haul must be less than or equal to the desired sample size *x* determined in step 2. In step 3, when the number of resampled lengths from step 2 in a haul $n_l$ is less than *x* then $n_l$ is used directly, if $n_l>x$ then a random draw of lengths is taken without replacement in step 3.

<!-- 1. reduce total number of length samples - wor  -->
<!-- 2. shuffle hauls - wr  -->
<!-- 3. shuffle lengths - wr  -->
<!-- 4. shuffle age data - wr -->
<!-- 5. resample lengths - wor  -->
<!-- 6. calculate length composition  -->
<!-- 7. calculate population abundance at length, using the results of step 6  -->
<!-- 8. calculate population abundance at age, using results of step 7 -->
<!-- 10. calculate effective samples size for ages and lengths, using results of step 7 and 8 -->

\begin{equation}
 l_{x} = 
  \begin{cases}
    n_l    & n_l\le x  \\
    n_{lx} & n_l > x, ~ wor
  \end{cases}
  (\#eq:eqn6)
\end{equation}

The bootstrap-simulation then repeated steps 1-3 iteratively for each sex sub-sample size determined in step 1, providing iterated sex-specific population abundance at length that was then compared to the historical sex-specific population abundance at length determined by the bottom trawl surveys.

We applied the bootstrap-simulation to species that were most commonly captured in the EBS, AI, and GOA bottom trawl surveys (Tables \@ref(tab:ai-avg-samples) - \@ref(tab:goa-avg-samples)). 
The sub-sample levels that we evaluated for subsequent sex determination from the length frequency collections were 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, and 175 samples. 
We also ran the bootstrap-simulation for the historical number of sexed length frequency collections without subsetting in order to compare the base level uncertainty to the increase in uncertainty gained through sub-sampling. 
We ran the bootstrap-simulation for 500 iterations, which was a level for which the variability in population abundance at length results had stabilized, and applied the bootstrap-simulation to the most recent 3 years of the respective bottom trawl surveys, which were the most indicative of the current sampling levels. 
The bootstrap-simulation was developed in R [@Rcore] and is available via GitHub as an R package (https://github.com/BenWilliams-NOAA/swo).

## Computing effective and input sample size

[Including what we have in the tech memo to build on - Pete and Matt]

Effective sample size, as introduced by @Mcallister1997, is a statistic that can evaluate the level of intra-haul correlation in composition samples that are collected on a survey (whether from age or length frequency collections). 
It is also a statistic that can evaluate the amount of uncertainty in an estimated composition compared to an observed composition. 
Effective sample size is given by:

\begin{equation}
 ESS=\frac{\sum_{c=1}^{C}E_c(1-E_c)}{\sum_{c=1}^{C}(E_c-O_c)^2}
 (\#eq:eqn7)
\end{equation}

where $E_c$ is the estimated proportion for category-*c* (which can be either age or length or any other arbitrary category across which proportions are computed) and $O_c$ is the observed proportion.
 
In this bootstrap-simulation the underlying length composition derived from the historical bottom trawl surveys was treated as the observed proportions $O_c$ in equation \@ref(eq:eqn7). 
For each iteration of the bootstrap simulation for a determined sex sub-sample size we computed a sex-specific estimated proportion ($E_c$) that was then compared to the underlying historical sex-specific length composition (the effective sample size for the total length composition, as the sum of population abundance at length, was also computed). 
Thus, across each iteration of the bootstrap simulation we computed an effective sample size that indicated the amount of increased uncertainty that was caused by sub-sampling sexed length frequency data. 
To summarize effective sample size across iterations we used the harmonic mean, which has been shown to reduce bias in recovering the true sample size in simulations for a multinomial distribution. 
Due to this reduction in bias the harmonic mean has also been recommended to determine the ‘input sample size’ that is used in stock assessment models to fit compositional data [@Stewart2014]. 
Herein, when we use the term ‘effective sample size’ we are referring to the effective sample sizes that were computed for each iteration of the bootstrap-simulation, when we use the term ‘input sample size’ we are referring to the harmonic mean of the iterated effective sample sizes.
