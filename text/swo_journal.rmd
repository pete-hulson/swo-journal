# Abstract 

Unavoidable survey effort reduction has become a reality that must be accounted for in modern stock assessment models. 
In addition, increasing negative consequences to survey staff health due to repetitive motion injuries are becoming a cost to managing agencies that is increasingly significant.
In this study, we evaluated the consequences of reductions in age and length data collections for composition data that are used in stock assessment models.
The main goal was to determine if sampling can be reduced to a level that does not excessively increase data uncertainty yet provides a reduction in repetitive motions that can cause injury to survey staff.
We found that reducing length sampling to a maximum of 100 to 150 fish sampled per haul (either sex-specific or combined sex) provides length composition data for which the uncertainty is not appreciably increased, and has no effect on the uncertainty in age composition data that is subsequently expanded from this sub-sampled length frequency data.
We also found that as the subsampling rate of total age collections is increased, the uncertainty in the age composition also increases, but not at a rate proportional to the reduction in sampling effort.
While there is a direct link between the uncertainty in data inputs and the uncertainty of assessment model predictions, reductions in length frequency sampling can be made without large consequences.
Conversely, there will be, at some level, consequences to model output with reductions in age collection sampling.
The method employed here, and the results presented, can aid managing agencies to balance the magnitude of data collection on fishery-independent survey platforms and subsequent consequences to assessment models.

# Introduction

Many integrated fishery stock assessments rely on information on fish population demographic composition in the form of length composition [@Punt2013] or as a derived quantity from length composition expanded to age composition [@Maunder2015]. 
The most reliable age and length composition estimates are based on observations from fishery-independent surveys because these platforms generally avoid the sample selection bias inherent in directed commercial fisheries [@NRC1998]. 
Past analyses have focused on the statistical efficiency of composition estimates for data weighting and applications to likelihood functions [e.g., @Thorson2014; @Thorson2017; @Francis2017]. 
It is recognized in sampling theory that increasing the number of samples increases the precision of the estimate, and from this perspective, one should require the maximum number of samples per each survey observation. 
Improvements in precision of age or length composition estimates are not only influenced by the magnitude of sampling, but also the manner in which the samples are collected [i.e., changing the number of samples collected within a haul versus changing the number of hauls from which samples were obtained; @Siskey2022]. 
Further, each fish sampled on a survey has an immediate physical labor cost (e.g., at-sea time management issues), a cumulative health cost (e.g., repetitive stress injuries), downstream labor costs (e.g., staff effort reading otoliths to determine age), and budget costs (e.g., the monetary cost to perform a fisheries-independent survey).

It is commonly understood that sampling to determine age and length composition of fishery-independent or fishery-dependent sources can be influenced by intra-haul correlation.
For example, @Pennington2000 demonstrated that fish sampled from a haul that are similar in size and/or age may not be representative of the overall population’s size and/or age distribution owing to pseudoreplication. 
To evaluate the level of intra-haul correlation, and account for it in fishery stock assessment, the concept of ‘effective sample size’ has been developed.
Effective sample size is smaller than the actual sample size reflecting the increase in uncertainty due to the intra-haul correlation displayed by the sampled species [e.g., @Mcallister1997]. 
A number of studies have used effective sample size to evaluate impacts on assessment results including whether effective sample size can be estimated within the assessment model [@Francis2017; @Thorson2017; @Hulson2012] and more recently as a tool to evaluate the effect of changes to sampling methodologies on assessment model uncertainty [@Siskey2023]. 
Further, methods have been developed that mimic the sampling designs for length and age composition to estimate effective sample size using bootstrap techniques external to an assessment model [@Stewart2014].
Overall, the use of effective sample size has become a recommended method to account for uncertainty caused by overdispersion of samples in length and age composition data.

Thousands of samples are obtained from a fishery-independent survey for both age and length composition across multiple species.
For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) is responsible for the execution of several fisheries-independent bottom trawl surveys [@Stauffer2004], spanning most of the continental shelf in waters off Alaska that are south of the Bering Strait, including the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), the Aleutian Islands (AI), and the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).
The quantitative time series of comprehensively cataloging the biota encountered at each sampling station within these surveys began in 1982 with the adoption of standardized trawling protocols [@Lauth2019], but trawl observations were made as early as 1955 [@Zimmermann2009].
AFSC scientists have routinely collected observations of fish length and age composition, consisting of complete or random subsamples of fish within each trawl haul throughout the time series.

There are a number of unintended consequences associated with intense sampling of species within a fishery-independent survey.
The length measurement process is repeated hundreds of thousands of times during an annual survey, and otolith sampling is repeated several thousands of times.
This represents a daunting amount of work for the field scientists on research vessels.
Further, a large portion of the fish sampeld for length frequency are subsequently sampled for sex determinations, which involves a substantial increase in handling and data collection effort.
Each year, this workflow results in acute and repetitive stress injuries, some requiring medical interventions and claims to the U.S. Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. 
Another consequence resulting from the intensity of this work is the introduction of unrecoverable errors to the observed data.
Despite extensive *in situ* quality assurance protocols, as fatigue or injuries accumulate during the course of field work, so do data collection errors (e.g. failure to properly encode length measurements with the correct species or sex or misidentification of sex), .
Aside from the budgetary constraints that are directly associated with operationalizing a fishery-independent survey, there are downstream financial costs associated with composition collections, in particular, requiring properly trained staff to accurately read otoliths collected across many species.

Maximizing the number of samples collected for age and length composition is desirable from a statistical viewpoint; however, it is important to accurately define the sampling unit  that needs to be optimized (e.g., the number of samples collected within a haul versus the number hauls from which samples are obtained).
In addition, optimizing collections that balance the statistical quality of the data with the health of the workforce and budgetary constraints is more broadly desirable.
At the AFSC, this balance is more often achieved by decreasing collection efforts from historical levels.
The primary concern, from a stock assessment perspective, when reducing the sampling of length frequency data and age composition data collections is the impact on the uncertainty in subsequent age and length composition data. 
To this end, effective sample size can be used as a tool to evaluate the consequences of changing sampling effort or strategies.
An additional consideration when evaluating the consequences of optimizing sampling effort is the impacts on a species specific basis to determine whether there are life-history characteristics that minimize the impacts of reduction in sampling effort in one species compared to another.

In this study, using data collected by the AFSC bottom trawl surveys across the EBS, AI, and GOA we evaluate the consequences of reductions in length frequency collections (including sex-specific length frequency) coupled with reductions in age composition sampling.
Using effective sample size as the primary statistic to evaluate uncertainty in the age and length composition data derived from AFSC bottom trawl surveys, we evaluated the impact of reduced sampling to answer three questions 1) what is the impact of reducing sampling in length frequency sampling (including sex determination sampling) and the subsequent expansion to age composition on the uncertainty in the composition data? 
2) What is the impact of reducing sampling for age on uncertainty in age composition data? 
3) Is there a point of diminishing returns as we increase the number of age and length samples? 
and 4) are there species specific characteristics that mitigate, or exaggerate, the consequences of reductions in age or length composition sampling?

# Methods

## Computing length and age composition from bottom trawl survey data

Data collection for each AFSC groundfish bottom trawl survey is described in respective NOAA Technical Memorandums [EBS: @Lauth2019; AI: @vonSzalay2017; GOA: @vonSzalay2018]. 
The fundamental methods of length sample collection are generally synchronized between these surveys, with species-specific exceptions for minimum length sub-sample size. 
Species and sex-specific length distributions within a catch sample are collected by 1) sorting the sample by species, 2) weighing each species in aggregate, 3) obtaining a random sub-sample of a target sample size, 4) sorting the sub-sample by sex (each fish is incised to visually determine sex), and 5) measuring length and recording each fish's measurements into a database. 
Additionally, a subsample of fish are processed at sea to collect their sex, length, weight, and sagittal otoliths. 
These otoliths are returned to the AFSC Age and Growth laboratory for age determination.
Survey age sampling protocols are species specific and follow 1 of 2 paradigms: 1) a stratified collection distributed over both the spatial frame of the stratification scheme and the expected size range of a species; or 2) a small subsample (3-6 fish, species dependent) collected randomly per trawl. 
The protocol for some species has changed over the time series, generally following a trend of transitioning from protocol 1) to protocol 2). 

Length frequency samples collected by the AFSC bottom trawl surveys are expanded by area-swept catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and stratum area to obtain estimates of population abundance-at-length (i.e., design-based expansion).
In a design-based expansion process, this is often referred to as the 'first stage expansion' and is a common method to obtain population estimates at length from area-swept survey data [@Ailloud2019; @Miller2006].
Population abundance-at-length are computed for three sex categories (males, females, and unsexed) at the stratum level, which are then summed across strata to obtain the population abundance-at-length for the management-scale region (i.e., EBS, AI, or GOA).
Strata are defined as regions with similar bathymetric characteristics (e.g., depth ranges), and population abundance-at-length within strata can also be summed to any sub-region level.
Age-length-keys (ALKs) generated from the age-length paired observations within a survey are then applied to estimated abundance-at-length to provide an estimate of abundance-at-age [e.g., @QuinnDeriso1999].
The specific methods AFSC uses to expand length and age samples to abundance are shown in @Hulson2023b. 

The stocks selected for this analysis are shown in Table \@ref(tab:species-samples) and were selected because all are assessed by AFSC with statistical catch-at-age models and have corresponding expanded age and/or length composition estimates from the respective bottom trawl surveys. 
Historical data for each survey were used in this analysis in order to show results that reflect consequences of sub-sampling. 
To show the recent sampling magnitudes, the average length and age sample sizes from the most recent three survey years for the stocks selected are shown in Table \@ref(tab:species-samples). 

## Simulation-Bootstrap framework

To evaluate the effect of reductions in sampling length frequency and specimen age data we developed a bootstrap-simulation framework that 1) allows for reductions in the historical number of length frequencies and specimen age data collected and 2) performs first (length) and second (age) stage expansion processes for each bootstrap replicate of length frequency and specimen age data to generate length and age compositions.
The bootstrap-simulation framework is composed of a suite of nested resampling protocols. 
Bootstrap resampling was performed either with replacement (wr) or without replacement (wor) depending on the needs of a particular protocol. 
Functions to run the sampling protocols were developed in a compartmentalized manner to provide substantial flexibility in exploring desired resampling protocols. 
The order of operations (Figure \@ref(fig:bs-flows) *ben - could we add in a part that sub-samples ages too to this figure?*) has the following schedule:

1. Resample hauls (wr) with associated catch per unit effort (in numbers). 
2. Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample haul-specific observed lengths (wr).
3. From the resampled lengths in step 2, subset the haul-specific length samples (wor) at the pre-determined subsampling level.
4. With the resampled and subsampled length frequency data in step 3, calculate sex-specific population abundance-at-length.
5. Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample the observed ages (wr).
6. From the resampled ages in step 5, subset the total ages sampled (wor) at pre-determined subsampling level.
7. With the resampled and subsampled age data in step 6 and the sex-specific population abundance-at-length in step 4, calculate sex-specific population abundance-at-age.

The core of the bootstrap-simulation function (steps 3 and 6 above) is designed to explore reductions in the sample size of lengths collected on a per haul basis, as well as in the total sample size for ages (aggregated across hauls). 
In step 3 of this bootstrap-simulation, the pre-determined subsampling level for lengths (whether total or sex-specific, $n_l$) in a given haul must be less than or equal to the sample size *x* collected in the historical data for that haul. 
When the pre-determined subsampling level for lengths in a haul $n_l$ is less than the historical sample size *x* for that haul then a random draw of $n_l$ from the resampled lengths in step 2 is taken without replacement, if $n_l>x$ then the resampled lengths of size *x* in step 2 is used directly. 
We set the subsampling level for length frequency at numbers per haul in order to evaluate the AFSC length sampling design. 
Additionally, to subsample ages we changed the proportion of the total number of ages sampled in step 6 to evaluate the consequences of reductions in overall age sampling, because the number of otoliths collected per haul for age analysis is typically small. 
The bootstrap-simulation repeated steps 1-7 iteratively for each length and age subsample level, providing iterated population abundance-at-length and age that was then compared to the population abundance-at-length and age calculated from the original data.

The length subsample levels that we evaluated from the full length frequency collections were 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 samples per haul. 
The age subsample levels that we evaluated from the full age specimen collections were 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% of the total number of ages collected in any given survey year. 
We also ran the bootstrap-simulation for the full number of length frequency and age specimen collections without subsetting to compare the base level uncertainty to the uncertainty observed as a result of sub-sampling. 
We ran the bootstrap-simulation for 500 iterations, which was a level beyond which variability in  results did not increase. 
The bootstrap-simulation was developed in R [@Rcore] and is available via GitHub as an R package (https://github.com/BenWilliams-NOAA/swo).

## Computing effective and input sample size

We used two performance metrics to quantify potential changes in uncertainty of length and age compositions (i.e., population abundance-at-length and age) owing to reduced sampling of length frequency and/or specimen age information.
First, effective sample size was used to compare each bootstrap replicate of length and age composition to the historically observed length and age composition.
Second, uncertainty across bootstrap replicates was summarized using the harmonic mean of effective sample size replicates to generate an "input sample size".

Effective sample size, as introduced by @Mcallister1997, is a statistic that can evaluate the level of intra-haul correlation in composition samples (whether from age or length frequency collections). 
It is also a statistic that can evaluate the amount of uncertainty in an estimated composition compared to an observed composition. 
Effective sample size is given by:

\begin{equation}
 ESS_{i,y}=\frac{\sum_{c=1}^{C}E_{c,i,y}(1-E_{c,i,y})}{\sum_{c=1}^{C}(E_{c,i,y}-O_{c,y})^2}
 (\#eq:eqn1)
\end{equation}

where $E_{c,i,y}$ is the estimated proportion for category-*c* (which can be either age or length or any other arbitrary category across which proportions are computed) in interation-*i* and year-*y* and $O_{c,y}$ is the historically observed proportion in year-*y*.
A larger ESS indicates higher certainty in the composition estimates, while lower ESS indicates less certainty. 

In this bootstrap-simulation the length and age compositions derived from the historical bottom trawl surveys' full datasets were treated as the observed proportions $O_c$ in equation \@ref(eq:eqn1). 
For each iteration of the bootstrap simulation for a pre-specified sub-sampling level we computed an estimated proportion ($E_c$) that was then compared to this observed sex-specific (and sex-aggregated total) length and age composition. 
Thus, across each iteration of the bootstrap simulation we computed an effective sample size that indicated the change in uncertainty caused by sub-sampling length frequency and age specimen data. 
The harmonic mean was used to summarize these effective sample sizes across iterations.
This has been shown to reduce bias in recovering the true sample size in simulations for a multinomial distribution and has been recommended to determine the ‘input sample size’ used as an initial weighting in stock assessment models to fit compositional data [@Stewart2014]. 
Herein, we use the term ‘iterated effective sample size’ (iterated ESS) to refer to the effective sample sizes computed for each iteration of the bootstrap-simulation, and we use the term ‘input sample size’ (ISS) to refer to the harmonic mean of the iterated effective sample sizes. 
We provide results of both the annual age and length composition ISS estimates and their relative size (proportion ISS) compared to the full dataset ISS. 
The proportion ISS was computed as the ISS at a pre-determined sub-sampling level divided by the full dataset ISS (no sub-sampling) for each survey year. 
This provides an indication of the amount of change in uncertainty due to reductions in sub-sampling rates.

# Results

As the number of samples taken within hauls for length frequency decreased, the ISS decreased, but not dramatically (Figure \@ref(fig:bs-length-iss)).
While we show the EBS stocks as an example, this trend of decreasing length composition ISS with decreasing haul sub-sampling level for length frequency also resulted across all regions, stocks, and sex categories evaluated.
For all stocks evaluated the sex-specific length composition ISS were smaller than the total (combined sex) ISS, this remained true within each individual sub-sampling case as well.
There were, however, stock-specific differences in the sex-specific ISS magnitude; if the magnitudes were different it was the case that female length composition ISS was larger than male length composition ISS.
While the magnitude of length composition ISS was stock-specific and sex category-specific, across survey years the length composition ISS generally ranged from 250 to 3,000.
The variability in length composition ISS across survey years and haul sub-sampling levels was also stock-specific, but the variability generally reduced as the haul sub-sampling level decreased.
Across the length frequency haul level sub-sampling cases evaluated, the magnitude of age composition ISS for all stocks within each region was unaffected by length sub-sampling (Figure \@ref(fig:ai-age-length-iss), shown for AI stocks as an example).

As the sub-sampling level within a haul for length frequency decreased the proportion of the full dataset length composition ISS decreased (Figure \@ref(fig:prop-length-iss)), following from the results of the decreasing trend in ISS magnitude across sub-sampling levels.
This decrease in the proportion of length composition sub-sampled ISS compared to full dataset ISS was consistent across the stocks evaluated, although the magnitude of decrease was region and stock-specific.
The largest decrease in the proportion of full dataset ISS across the sub-sampling levels evaluated resulted for EBS walleye pollock, where the smallest decrease resulted for GOA rex sole and southern rock sole.
The largest variability across survey years in the proportion of full dataset ISS with the sub-sampling levels of 50 and 100 lengths per haul resulted for AI walleye pollock and GOA northern rockfish.
For sub-sampling levels of 150 and greater the variability the the proporiton of full dataset length composition ISS was small and consistent across all the stocks evaluated.

While the magnitude of decrease in the proportion of length composition ISS was region and sex-specific, none of the stocks decreased to lower than 50% of the full dataset ISS; the majority of stocks did not decrease to lower than 60%.
For all the stocks evaluated, the range in the annual proportion of full dataset ISS across the sex categories evaluated were either above or included 90% of the full dataset length composition ISS for the length frequency sub-sampling levels of 100 fish per haul; the only exception was for EBS walleye pollock female and male proportion of length composition ISS.
Besides EBS walleye pollock, in which the range in the annual proportion of full dataset ISS included 90%, the remainder of the stocks evaluated resulted in proportions of full dataset ISS greater than 90% for length frequency sub-sampling levels of 150 fish per haul or more regardless of length composition sex category.
Sampling at a level of 100 to 150 fish per haul for length frequency would result in 8,000 to greater than 30,000 fewer collections per-year within the surveys evaluated (Table \@ref(tab:ss-saved)).

Where the age composition ISS was unaffected by the length frequency sub-sampling level, the age composition ISS did markedly decrease as the proportion of total age collections decreased (Figure \@ref(fig:goa-age-iss)).
In Figure \@ref(fig:goa-age-iss) we use the stocks in the GOA bottom trawl survey as an example and note that this result was consistent across all regions, stocks, and sex categories evaluated.
Similar to the results for length composition ISS, the sex-specific age composition ISS were smaller than the total (combined sex) iterated ISS across all stocks evaluated, and the magnitude of age composition ISS compared between sex categories (female and male) could differ by stocks.
Following the results of the sex-specific length composition ISS, if the magnitudes in age composition ISS were different between the sex categories, the female age composition ISS was larger than the male age composition ISS.
The magnitude of sex-specific and total ISS were stock-specific, and ranged from 10 to 500; smaller than the length composition ISS in the same year for the same stock.
The variability in annual age composition ISS was also stock specific, where some stocks displayed larger range in age composition ISS across survey years than others.

The proportion of decrease from the full dataset age composition ISS was region and stock-specific, as was the variability in the decrease in age composition ISS across the survey years (Figure \@ref(fig:prop-age-iss)).
Some of the largest decreases in age composition ISS across the total age sub-sampling levels resulted for arrowtooth flounder and Pacific cod in each survey evaluated, where the smallest decrease resulted for GOA walleye pollock.
The largest variability across the survey years in the proportion of ISS across age sub-sampling levels again resulted for Pacific cod, but also included AI Atka mackerel and walleye pollock across each survey area, while the variablity was relatively small for the remaining stocks.
Even though there were differences in the proportion of age composition ISS across the age sub-sampling levels evaluated, the results across stocks were generally consistent.

A notable result was that for all stocks evaluated, the proportional decrease in age composition ISS was dampened when compared to the proportional decrease in total age samples collected (Figure \@ref(fig:prop-age-iss-nss)).
For example, a reduction to 25% of the total age samples did not translate to a sub-sampled dataset age composition ISS reduction of 25% of the full dataset ISS, but rather resulted in a sub-sampled dataset age composition ISS of 30-40% of the full dataset ISS; this was true at each total age collection sub-sampling level evaluated.
For rockfish and flatfish, the reduction in ISS compared to the reduction in total age samples were similar, both across stocks and sex categories.
In comparison, for gadids and other (Atka mackerel), the reduction in age composition ISS compared to reduction in total age samples was further dampened, where the reduction in total age samples resulted in a proportionally smaller reduction in age composition ISS compared to rockfish and flatfish stocks.
Regardless, for all stocks and sex categories evaluated, the reduction in ISS was less than the reduction in the total age samples collected on the surveys.

# Discussion

In this study, we developed a method to evaluate the consequences of reduced sampling effort on uncertainty in age and length composition data and demonstrated the proportional decrease in the ISS due to reductions in sampling.
We found that the ISS for age composition data was more sensitive to reductions in sampling effort than the ISS for length composition.
While the age composition ISS was sensitive to reductions in age sampling effort, we also show that the ISS for age composition was unaffected by the level of sub-sampling in the length frequency collections.
Looking across multiple survey regions revealed that these reductions in ISS, or increase in uncertainty, of length and age composition were stock specific, but generally consistent.
We find, based on the proportional decrease in ISS from sub-sampled data compared to full datasets, that there are recommendations that can be made to balance age and length collections on fishery-independent platforms with considerations of the amount of effort required to obtain these collections.

An unknown, but desirable outcome of research would be to specify how many length frequency collections are necessary to provide adequate information to stock assessment models.
@Gerritsen2007 suggested that sampling rates for length frequency be 10 fish per length category based on the mean weighted coefficient of variation statistic.
In practical implementation, their suggestion would result in stock-specific sampling rates at the haul level, where larger fish would require more samples, and smaller fish would require less.
While this is a result that makes biological sense, and is attractive as it is related to life-history characteristics of the stocks being sampled, it could result in logistical difficulties when implemented 'on deck' during a survey.
We suggest, alternatively, that a more logistically feasible length frequency sampling method would be to set the same sampling rate across stocks at the haul level, recognizing that length frequencies for some stocks may be over-sampled.
Here, we find that limiting sampling at 100 to 150 fish within a haul (whether for total or sex-specific length composition) would provide length composition data that have relatively similar uncertainty compared to length composition data derived from sampling at more intense rates (within 10% of the full dataset length composition ISS).
We conclude, therefore, that there is little added benefit, in terms of reduced uncertainty, beyond sampling limits of 100 to 150 fish lengths per haul.
This indicates as well that we are beyond a saturation point, or a point of diminishing returns in the improvements made by any increased sampling effort in these surveys for length composition, however, this is not the case for age composition sampling.

A related desirable outcome of research is to determine how many age collections are necessary to provide adequate information to stock assessments models.
Based on the results of this analyses, we find the answer to this question to remain elusive.
As we increased the subsampling rates for age composition there was no 'leveling off' of age composition ISS that would indicate a point of diminishing returns had been met like that which resulted for length composition ISS. 
In fact, as the subsampling rates were increased the age composition ISS continued to increase.
In a similar study, @Siskey2022 evaluated increasing age sampling beyond current sampling levels for a subset of stocks evaluated here using a bootstrap approach and also found that the age composition ISS continued to increase, even at levels of increasing current sampling levels by 67%.
In order to determine whether and where age composition ISS reaches a point of diminishing returns simulation studies may be a more appropriate approach than bootstrapping historical data, as variables such as life-history or intra-haul correlation can be accounted for specifically [e.g., similar to @Hulson2011; @Xu2020].
The results of our study, and ones like @Siskey2022, suggest that the number of age samples beyond which there is no improvement to age composition information are likely beyond the current management agency capacities to sample and read by ageing laboratories.
In terms of what is necessary to provide adequate information to stock assessment models, the historical sampling levels have resulted in model outcomes that seem to have provided reasonable advice for management of North Pacific fish stocks.
Our recommendation, therefore, is to attempt to retain historical levels of sampling for age composition, with the recognition that there are consequences to age composition uncertainty with reductions in these rates that will have downstream effects on assessment model uncertainty.

Across the stocks evaluated, the decrease in length composition ISS as haul sub-sampling rates increased were extremely consistent, and no clear pattern emerged that seemed to be related to life-history, however, there were interesting species type patterns that emerged when considering the effect of reduction in age sampling rates and the subsequent age composition ISS.
Overall we found that the effect of decreasing age sampling rates was not one-to-one in relation to the rate of decrease in age composition ISS, but rather had a dampened effect.
For example, a 10% reduction in age sampling effort did not result in a 10% reduction in age composition ISS, but rather a 5-8% reduction, depending on the stock.
Although, when comparing across species types we noted that the effect of reductions in age sampling efforts was relatively larger for flatfish and rockfish as compared to gadids (and Atka mackerel).
That is, a reduction in age sampling effort for flatfish and rockfish has a relatively larger impact on the reduction in age composition ISS as compared to gadids.
A similar result occurred in @Hulson2017, where it was found that age sample size had a relatively larger effect on the uncertainty in age composition data for rockfish, then flatfish, then gadids (including Atka mackerel).
In terms of assessment outcome, @Siskey2022 showed that increasing or decreasing age sampling effort for the rockfish examples used had a larger subsequent effect on the uncertainty in management quantities than the gadid example, indicating that this relatively larger effect on age composition ISS translates through the assessment model as well.
An extenuating circumstance that should be considered when evaluating the consequences of age sampling effort reduction for flatfish, is that all of the stocks included in this analysis are managed through the use of sex-specific assessment models.
We show that, in comparison to the total (combined sex) age (and length) composition ISS the sex-specific age (and length) composition ISS is smaller, and between the two sexes there can be differences in the magnitude of ISS, often resulting in ISS that is larger for female age composition as compared to male.
It must be noted that reductions in age sampling effort for flatfish will have further downstream effects when considering uncertainty in sex-specific age composition.
While we encourage maintaining historical levels of age sampling effort, we additionally recommend that if reductions are to be considered in age sampling effort that decision-makers consider the unequal consequences of these reductions across species types.

Recently, a large amount of effort has been dedicated to evaluating the consequences of reductions in survey effort [@ICES2020; @ICES2023].
The results of this analysis fits with previous work...
*Meaghan, Jason, and Matt - I think all of you have been involved with WKUSER, could you add some text here to compare what we've done with what was done in the WKUSER workshops, maybe focusing on whether any work was done focusing on comp data?*

While the focus of the analysis in this study was to evaluate the statistical consequences of effort reduction when collecting age and length samples, our stated goal was to speak to the balance between stock assessment input data uncertainty and workforce health and efficiency.
We show that the length frequency sampling can be reduced from current sampling levels without major consequences to length composition uncertainty, this was true for both total (combined sex) and sex-specific data.
While collecting total length frequency data is cheap, in terms of effort required to collect only the length from a fish, determining sex from a fish requires additional effort.
*Jason - could you add a couple of sentences here with more detail from the 'on-deck' perspective?*

When collecting age samples the additional effort that is required beyond determining the sex of a fish involves removing the sagittal otoliths which is then sent for subsequent reading to an age reading laboratory.
Thus, for age sampling there is additional effort beyond 'on-deck' sampling that is required by a managing agency.
The cost for several stocks evaluated here is summarized in @Lambert2017 and further evaluated in @Siskey2022, which show that the monetary expense of each otolith is not inconsequential and the savings to an agency upon reducing age sampling could be in the tens of thousands of dollars (USD).
However, @Siskey2022 showed that there are downstream effects of increased uncertainty in assessment model estimates of the Over Fishing Level when age sampling is reduced.
While buffers in catch limits due to assessment model uncertainty [e.g., @Prager2003] are not yet incorporated in North Pacific fishery stock assessments, such buffers that would reduce catch limits based on increased uncertainty in assessment model quantities that are from increased uncertainty in age composition data due to reduced sampling would have direct effects on the value of the fisheries targeting these stocks.
*Matt - anything to add from your paper?*
*Jason - could you speak to the balance with workforce health here?*

Overall, we demonstrate a method from which a balance can be evaluated between stock assessment needs and workforce health and efficiency.
Similar to what was done here, we recommend that fishery-independent survey groups collaborate with stock assessment scientists to determine if efficiency can be improved for age and length collections, here we found that improved efficiency could be obtained by reducing the amount of length frequency data (both total and sex-specific) on a haul-level basis.
Future work to evaluate the consequences of reducing, or increasing, composition data collections should include developing simulation methods that can directly evaluate variables such as life-history characteristics and intra-haul correlation levels.
